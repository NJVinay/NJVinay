# Hello! I'm N Jyotir Vinay.

I'm Vinay, a dedicated student and passionate programmer exploring the diverse world of technology. Here, I document my journey through coding, projects, and continual learning as I work toward meaningful innovations in the tech landscape.

## About Me

In the field of programming, I work with various languages and tools, particularly Python, Java, and Web Development, to build efficient solutions for a range of technical challenges. I enjoy experimenting with machine learning, data science, and object-oriented design to create impactful projects.

## Key Projects

### 1. npc_memory – Emotion-Aware AI NPC Dialogue System 🎮🧠
- **Description:** Built an interactive NPC dialogue system using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and local LLMs (Mistral/DeepSeek) for memory-aware, emotionally responsive gameplay experiences.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, FastAPI, Ollama LLMs, PostgreSQL, Sentiment Analysis (RoBERTa), HTML/CSS/JS
- **Repository:** [npc_memory](https://github.com/NJVinay/npc_memory)

### 2. GamePlan – Personalized Fitness & Task Tracking App 🏋️📱
- **Description:** A dynamic task tracker for fitness routines with geolocation-based attendance, trainer-assigned goals, and progress analytics.
- **Technologies Used:** JavaScript, Firebase, HTML/CSS, Geolocation API
- **Repository:** [GamePlan](https://github.com/NJVinay/GamePlanApp)

### 3. BarrelBound – 2.5D RPG Shooter Game 🎮🔥
- **Description:** A team-built game jam entry developed in Unity. I contributed core mechanics like weapon pickups, aiming, shooting, UI/UX polish, and menu logic.
